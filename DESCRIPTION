Description: This package contains text analysis tools developed for the 
    Responsible Terrorism Coverage (ResTeCo) project, as well as gold standard
    data and annotations for replicating our analyses. We used data from The Guardian, 
    which is freely available from their API, for our gold standard data. This package 
    includes code to download this data, and vignettes that show how to replicate our 
    validation analyses.
